My interview on my international experience as a researcher has been published on the Italian newspaper [Gazzetta dell'Emilia](https://www.gazzettadellemilia.it/cultura/item/51954-lavoro-migrante-pamela-ferretti). I would like to thank Prof. Francesca Dallatana for the interview and for her important work on migrant workers.
