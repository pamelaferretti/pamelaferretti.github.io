Our new paper on the diversity and composition of eukaryotes in the gut microbiome of wild baboons is now published in [Animal Microbiome](https://animalmicrobiome.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42523-025-00436-6)! This work was led by the brilliant Mary Chege, in collaboration with the Alberts, Tung, and Archie labs.
