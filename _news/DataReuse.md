New guidelines for equitable sequence data reuse are now published in [Nature Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-02116-2). Grateful to [Prof. Alex Probst](https://www.uni-due.de/probst-lab/) and his team for leading this important work and for bringing together 160+ microbiome scientists (myself included) to contribute.
