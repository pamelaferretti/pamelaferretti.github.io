Great experience attending [CSHL Microbiome](https://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings.aspx?meet=BIOME)! I presented our work on milk and infant gut microbiome, and the talented student [Mary Chege](https://bsky.app/profile/mchege.bsky.social) presented our work on the eukaryotes in the gut of wild baboons.
