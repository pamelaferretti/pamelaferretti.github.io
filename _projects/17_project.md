Designing the logo for the Blekhman lab was a lot of fun! Together with Rich Abdill and Sabrina Arif, we tried to create a logo that included the main topics of research of the lab: human genetics, metagenomics and metabolomics data analysis. Of course we included also the chicago skyline, which is visible from our offices!
The logo was designed in Inkscape.
