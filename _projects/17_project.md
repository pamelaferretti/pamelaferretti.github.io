Designing the logo for the Blekhman lab was a lot of fun! Together with Rich Abdill and Sabrina Arif, we tried to create a logo that included the main topics of research of the lab: human genetics, metagenomics and metabolomics data analysis. Of course we included also the chicago skyline, which is visible from our offices!
The logo was designed in Inkscape, below one of the first drafts:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/16.jpeg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Blekhman Lab Logo - first draft
</div>

and here the final version:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/17.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
   Blekhman Lab Logo - final version
</div>
