When vaccines and mRNA were everywhere on the news, lots of people found themeselves struggling to understand which sources were credible and which were not. I started drawing some illustrations with pen and paper for my family members and friends that had reached out to me to ask questions. I quickly realised that the sketches I was doing could be useful to other people beyond my family, and that's how the idea of [Easy Infographics](https://easy-infographics.github.io/) started. This project, born during the pandemic lockdowns, was an attempt to help reducing misinformation about mRNA vaccines using clear, user-friendly graphics. So I reached out to [Eleonora Nigro](https://www.eleonoranigro.com/), a talented young researcher with a passion for graphical illustration, and asked her if she wanted to join the team.

As the goal was to increase scientific outreach on this important topic, we asked friends and colleagues to help us translate the illustrations in 7 languages: English, Italian, Spanish, Portugese, French, German and Russian! (see website for full credits list). 


We did every illustration with a more fun theme:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    How does the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine work?
</div>

and one a bit more traditional:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    How does the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine work?
</div>

This project was also our way to cope with the lockdowns while being away from our families, and to make a difference, no matter how small.
