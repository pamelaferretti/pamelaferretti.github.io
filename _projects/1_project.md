I helped designing in collaboration with Iris Kruijen (EMBL Press Office) and Alexandra Krolik (EMBL Design Lab), the cover for Cell Host & Microbe, issue of July 2018. The cover features a mother protecting her infant with an umbrella, surrounded by a colorful microbial world. The CHM issue included two back-to-back publications: Ferretti et al. and Yassour et al.
