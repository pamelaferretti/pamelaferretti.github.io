Our Review ["Diversity within species: interpreting strains in microbiomes"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0368-1) was featured on the cover of the September Issue of Nature Reviews Microbiology. In this Review we discussed what are the levels of taxonomic resolution below the species-level, and we address questions such what is a strain? how can we identify and interpret strains in microbiome data?. We also discuss pitfalls, limitations and best practices when studying and interpreting strains.
