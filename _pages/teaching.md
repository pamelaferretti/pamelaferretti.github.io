Universities have the important role of educating the future generations and providing the students the tools to improve the status quo, irrespectively of the field of expertise. I consider my goals as a teacher to be i) guiding the students to develop and adopt critical thinking and a scientific approach in problem solving within, as well as outside, of the classroom; ii) promoting active engagement of the students in the topic of the lesson, rather than asking them to be passive listeners.
