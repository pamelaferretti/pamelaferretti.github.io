In my opinion, the future can be influenced by two factors: (i) research and (ii) education of the next generation. Therefore, teaching is an important part of my academic life. I see it as my responsibility as a researcher and lecturer to motivate students and get them excited about the subjects they are studying. More precisely, I want to give the students a good mixture of scientific theory as well as practical knowledge. From my point of view, it is necessary for students to have theoretical knowledge in order to understand the concepts of current and future technologies. At the same time, of course, I also want to provide students with practical know-how by introducing them to current applications and research areas. On top of this, I want to create a learning environment that values diversity, equity, and inclusion.
