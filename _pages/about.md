I am a computer scientist working as a postdoctoral scholar at [Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/) led by Prof. Ian Foster in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago since November 2022. I am also the founder and elected chair of the [SPEC RG Predictive Data Analytics Working Group](https://research.spec.org/working-groups/rg-predictive-data-analytics/).

In a nutshell, my research aims to expand the potential of data science in scientific computing. In other words, my research contributes to key aspects of developing intuitive, efficient, and sustainable data science solutions across disciplines and domains. In addition, my research is inherently interdisciplinary, and I apply a translational approach as I work to develop, apply, and evaluate methods and techniques in various domains. In the long term, I expect that my research will contribute to the creation of dynamic data science ecosystems that will inherently accelerate scientific computing applications. 

My primary research interests focus on the following areas integrating experience and expertise from performance engineering and data science, but is not limited to: 
* Data science: My focus is on data analytics, clustering, and imputation. I am also interested in benchmarking and developing data analytics methods. In addition, my research is inherently interdisciplinary, and I apply a translational approach to transfer methods and techniques in various domains.
* Data science clouds: I am interested in the development, autonomous management (i.e., autonomous scaling of resources), benchmarking of various building blocks of such clouds, and runtime prediction and scheduling of data analytic tasks.
* Data management: The focus is on FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data management and the promotion of publicly available research data.
* Data privacy: The idea here is to exchange data with third parties, preserving the privacy of the data. I am interested in synthetic data generation and homomorphic encryption.
* Sustainable data science: Specifically, this involves the development of an energy efficiency benchmark for Deep and Machine Learning.
