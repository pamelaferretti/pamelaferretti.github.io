I am a Computational Biologist in the Laboratory of [Prof. Ran Blekhman](http://blekhmanlab.org/) at the University of Chicago, where I study microbial transmission in human and wild baboon populations through metagenomic and genomic approaches. 

I am interested in studying how commensal as well as pathogenic bacteria spread and persist in individuals that are in close social contact, like a mother with her infant or the individuals of a troop of baboons.
