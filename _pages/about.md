I'm a postdoctoral scholar in the Laboratory of [Prof. Ran Blekhman](http://blekhmanlab.org/) at the University of Chicago, where I study microbial transmission in human and wild baboon populations through metagenomic and genomic approaches. I am interested in studying how commensal as well as pathogenic bacteria spread and persist in individuals that are in close social contact, like a mother with her infant or the individuals of a troop of baboons. In particular, my current projects are focused on:

- Investigating strain transmission between the maternal breast milk and her infant's gut microbiome. Surprisingly, very little is known on the milk microbiome composition at the species and strain level, with milk representing < 0.3% of all metagenomic samples in public repositories! We aim to change that :) This project is in collaboration with [Prof. Cheryl Gale](https://med.umn.edu/bio/cheryl-gale) and [Prof. Ellen Demerath](https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/ellen-demerath).

- Strain transmission within a population of wild baboons that has been studied for over 50 years, as part of the [Amboseli Baboon Research Project](https://amboselibaboons.nd.edu/). This project is in collaboration with [Prof. Elisabeth Archie](https://sites.nd.edu/archielab/) and [Prof. Jenny Tung](http://www.tung-lab.org/) and their lab members. 

Before coming to the US, I lived in Heidelberg (Germany), where I received my PhD in the Laboratory of [Prof. Peer Bork at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)](https://www.embl.org/groups/bork/). For my main project, I put together a collection of 42,900 publicly available metagenomic samples, curated their associated metadata, and then leveraged this dataset to investigate the global biogeography and genetic variability of C. difficile, a clinically relevant species. In my study, I focused in particular on healthy pediatric populations, which are usually excluded from traditional clinical studies due to their usual aymptomatomatic carriage of this species. 

I did my undergraduate studies in Trento (Italy), in the Laboratory of [Prof. Nicola Segata](http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/), where I led a study investigating how the maternal microbial communities seed and shape the infant microbiome in the first semester of life. For this project, I collected 2,200 samples over the course of 3 years, and I worked in close contact with the neonatologists and OB/GYNs at the Santa Chiara Hospital in Trento. I really enjoyed every bit of this project, which sparked my interested in microbiome research.
