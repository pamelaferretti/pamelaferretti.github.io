**C. difficile: pathogen or commensal?**
C. difficile has been listed by the CDC among the most urgent threats in hospital-acquired infections, and it is often described in the literature as "well known human pathogen" responsible for C. difficile infection (CDI). My PhD work focused on investigating the composition and stability of the gut microbiome in presence of C. difficile. To do so, I first studied C. difficile in the most obvious context: CDI patients. However, among those patients, C. difficile carriage was suprisingly low: only 30%. I instead found elevated carriage of other pathogenic species that are known to be able to induce CDI-like symptomatology, suggesting over-diagnosis in the evaluated studies. I then expanded my scope of study, including not only public metagenomic studies on adult/elderly CDI patients, but also healthy subjects of all ages, animals and the environment. I put together a collection of 42,900 publicly available metagenomic samples, curated their associated metadata, and then leveraged this dataset to investigate the global biogeography and genetic variability of C. difficile. I found that C. difficile is most prevalent (up to 76%) and abundant in healthy infants, and that C. difficile in this age group is associated with multiple indicators of a healthy infant gut microbiome development. **This study represents the  largest single-species metagenomic survey to date, providing systematic, world-wide analysis of C. difficile carriage and associated microbiome composition.**

**Mother-to-infant microbiome transmission**
I led a study investigating how the maternal microbiome seeds and shapes the infant microbiome in the first semester of life. For this study, I collected 2,000+ samples over the course of 3 years, and I worked in close contact with the neonatologists and OB/GYNs at the Santa Chiara Hospital in Trento.
