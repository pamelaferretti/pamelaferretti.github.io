Before coming to the US, I lived in Heidelberg (Germany), where I received my PhD in the Laboratory of [Prof. Peer Bork at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)](https://www.embl.org/groups/bork/). For my main project, I put together a collection of 42,900 publicly available metagenomic samples, curated their associated metadata, and then leveraged this dataset to investigate the global biogeography and genetic variability of C. difficile, a clinically relevant species. In my study, I focused in particular on healthy pediatric populations, which are usually excluded from traditional clinical studies due to their usual aymptomatomatic carriage of this species. 

Before that, I led a study investigating how the maternal microbiome seeds and shapes the infant microbiome in the first semester of life. For this study, which was initiated when I was in the Laboratory of [Prof. Nicola Segata](http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/), I collected 2,000+ samples over the course of 3 years, and I worked in close contact with the neonatologists and OB/GYNs at the Santa Chiara Hospital in Trento. I really enjoyed every bit of this project, which sparked my interested in microbiome research.
